# Credit Risk Prediction 

## Objective
Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default using machine learning models.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Loan Prediction Problem Dataset
- Columns:
  - Loan_ID, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed
  - ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term
  - Credit_History, Property_Area, Loan_Status
- Link: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset)

## Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning: handled missing values, encoded categorical data, scaled numeric features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: visualized key features like LoanAmount, Education, ApplicantIncome.
3. Model Training: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.
4. Model Evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
5. Conclusion: Logistic Regression performed slightly better with higher accuracy.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload the dataset (`loan_dataset.csv`) when prompted.
3. Run all cells to reproduce results.
